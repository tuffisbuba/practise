0 Introduction
The previous two chapters considered the characteristics of traditional investments in the
domestic market. In this chapter we look at:
 indirect ways of accessing investments through pooled investment vehicles called
collective investment schemes (CISs)
 gaining exposure to movements of investments, commodities etc by using derivatives
 the advantages and disadvantages of investing overseas and issues relating to investing in
emerging markets.

1 Collective investment schemes
1.1 What is a collective investment scheme?
Collective investment schemes (usually called mutual funds in the United States) provide
structures for the management of investments on a grouped basis. They provide the
opportunity for investors to achieve a wide spread of investments and therefore to lower
portfolio risk. Managers of such schemes are likely to have management expertise,
particularly in specialist areas such as overseas investment, which is otherwise available
only to the largest institutional investors.
Collective investment schemes offer the opportunity for indirect investment, ie investment
through an investment scheme rather than direct purchase of the underlying assets. A key
distinction between direct and indirect investment is whether the investor’s assets are segregated
from other investors’ money.
The collective investment scheme will have a stated investment objective. The objective might be
anything from general investment (whatever the investment manager chooses) to a specialism,
eg in small bio-technology companies.
As collective investment schemes provide investment expertise and diversification, they are
commonly used by individuals wanting to invest in shares for the first time.
The regulations covering collective investment schemes vary from country to country and
different types of scheme will be subject to different rules. Regulations typically cover
aspects such as:
 the categories of assets that can be held
 whether unquoted assets can be held
 the maximum level of gearing
 any tax relief available.
Some schemes may only be available to certain classes of institutional investors, such as
pension funds.
1.2 Closed-end and open-ended collective investment schemes
There are two fundamental types of collective investment schemes: closed-ended and
open-ended.
Closed-ended schemes
In a closed-ended scheme, such as an investment trust, once the initial tranche of money
has been invested the fund is closed to new money. After launch, the only way of investing
in an investment trust is to buy units from a willing seller (exactly as investing in ordinary
shares in a trading company).
Under a closed-ended scheme, the total number of shares or units available to the investors via
the marketplace is therefore fixed.

Open-ended schemes
In contrast, in an open-ended scheme such as a unit trust or open-ended investment
company, managers can create or cancel units in the fund as new money is invested or
disinvested.
1.3 Examples of collective investment scheme
Investment trusts
What is an investment trust?
Investment trusts are a form of closed-ended fund. They are public companies whose function is
to manage shares and other investments. They have a capital structure exactly like other public
companies, and can raise both loan and equity capital.
Despite the name, an investment trust is a company (and not a trust). The ability to borrow is a
major difference between investment trust companies and unit trusts. Unit trusts have limited
power to borrow.
Most investment trust shares are quoted on a stock exchange, and their shares are bought and
sold in a similar way to other quoted shares.
Share price
As investment trusts are closed-ended, an investor will buy from another investor in the same
way as for any other share. The price of a share in an investment trust company is determined by
supply and demand, in exactly the same way as for other shares.
A guide to what that share price might be expected to be is the net asset value per share (NAV),
which is the value of the company’s underlying assets divided by the number of shares.
The main parties involved
The main parties in an investment trust are the:
 Board of directors – responsible for the direction of the company
 Investment managers – responsible for the day-to-day investment decisions
 Shareholders – who buy and sell the shares in the investment trust company in the same
way as they would in any other company.
Unit trusts
What is a unit trust?
A unit-trust is an open-ended investment vehicle whereby investors can buy units in an underlying
pool of assets from the trust manager. If there is demand for units, the managers can create
more units for sale to investors. If there are redemptions (sales by investors), the managers will
buy back the units offered to them.

Unit trusts are trusts in the legal sense. They have limited powers to borrow against their
portfolio.
Unit price
The price that has to be paid to purchase one unit is the unit price. This unit price is calculated
(usually daily) by the unit trust provider.
In simple terms, the unit price will be calculated as:
Market value of underlying assets
Number of units .
In practice, complications include:
 whether to use the bid or offer prices of the underlying assets
 how to allow for the expenses the unit trust incurs in buying and selling underlying assets
 how to adjust the unit price to apply any charges to investors
 how to round the answer.
The main parties involved
A unit trust is an investment medium set up as a trust by a management company under a trust
deed. The main parties involved are:
 Management company – does all the work, sets up the trust, gets authorisation from the
relevant authorities, advertises the trust, carries out all the necessary administration and
invests the funds. Its aim is to make a profit from the charges levied. Many life offices act
as unit trust managers.
 Trustees – as in any legal trust, ensure that the managers obey the trust deed and hold
the assets in trust for the unit holders. The trustees oversee the pricing of units. The fees
to the trustees are paid by the unit trust managers. The trustees are often an insurance
company or large bank.
 Investors – buy units in the trust (and thus become unitholders), hoping that they turn out
to be a good investment.
Open-ended investment company (OEIC)
An investment vehicle similar in corporate governance features to an investment trust but
with the open-ended characteristics of a unit trust.

2 Differences between closed-ended and open-ended CISs
The differences between closed-ended and open-ended collective investment schemes can be
summarised as follows:
 The marketability of the shares of closed-ended funds is often less than the
marketability of their underlying assets.
However shares in a closed-ended fund may be more marketable than the underlying
assets if the assets themselves are unmarketable, eg property investment or shares in
small companies.
The marketability of units in an open-ended fund is guaranteed by the managers.
 Gearing of closed-ended funds can make the shares more volatile than the
underlying equity.
Investment trusts are companies and can borrow, eg by issuing loan capital, like any
quoted company. Gearing results in more volatile but higher expected returns to
shareholders. Not all investment trusts borrow, so these comments apply only to those
that do.
Most open-ended funds cannot be geared and those that can may only be geared to
a limited extent.
Unit trusts have very limited powers to borrow. For example, in the UK, retail authorised
unit trusts can borrow an amount equal to up to 10% of fund value.
 It may be possible to buy assets at less than net asset value in a closed-ended fund.
Traditionally the price of shares in investment trusts is often less than the value of the
underlying securities (ie the NAV).
The fact that this difference between the actual share price and the NAV exists is a source
of extra volatility in the return on investment trust company investment.
The average amount of discount from time to time will vary depending on whether
investment trusts are in or out of favour. When they are out of favour (often after the
stock market has had a prolonged bad run) the average discount may be quite wide, say
20% to 30%. At other times the discounts may narrow to just a few percent.
Investment trusts at a discount to NAV give investors an opportunity to increase their
returns. This can be achieved as follows:
– by buying when the discounts are large and selling when they have narrowed, or
– by buying into an investment trust at a discount to net asset value, the investor
effectively has the benefit of those assets (ie the income) having paid less than if
the assets had been purchased directly.
The concept of discount to net asset value does not apply to unit trusts because the unit
price is fixed by direct reference to the asset values.

 The increased volatility of closed-ended funds means that they should provide a
higher expected return.
 Shares in closed-ended funds are also more volatile than the underlying equity
because the size of the discount can change. The volatility of units in an
open-ended fund should be similar to that of the underlying assets.
 At any point in time there may be uncertainty as to the true level of net asset value
per share of a closed-ended fund, especially if the investments are unquoted.
 Closed-ended funds may be able to invest in a wider range of assets than unit trusts.
 They may be subject to tax at different rates.
Question
The actual share price of many investment trust companies is often lower than the NAV, ie the
share price is said to be at a discount to NAV.
Suggest possible reasons for this.
Solution
An investment trust company’s (ITC’s) shares might stand at a discount to NAV due to:
 Management charges – the value of an ITC share might be thought of as the present value
of the dividends the investor will receive. The investor will receive the dividends from the
underlying share investment but only after deduction of the management charges of the
ITC. Therefore, the management charges will have the effect of lowering the value of the
share, causing it to stand at a discount to its NAV.
 Concerns over marketability – a small ITC investing in shares of large companies will be a
less marketable investment than the underlying assets.
 Concerns over the quality of management – if the investment managers are poorly rated
then investors will not be prepared to pay as much for a share in an investment trust.
 Market sentiment / fashion – ITCs may be out of fashion with investors.
